# Tic Tac Toe

Human user is always selected to be "X". Choose tiles to create a row, column or diagonal of X's to win.
The bot is designed to choose a random starting tile then base its decision around the humans selections.
If the human user has a chance to win then the bot will decide if they can win or if they need to stop their opponent.
